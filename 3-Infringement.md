# 3.0 Protecting the integrity of the Sansar Marketplace

It is harmful to the marketplace when a user of sansar uploads an Avatar, accesory, or 3d model that is not there own. it is unfair to an artist to compete with other people calling themselves artist that dont make their own art. No matter if the excuse is that the item is for free or is for people that are new users that dont know how to build. You as a user of sansar after November 12th 2022 cannot upload any model to the sansar marketplace that is not there own creation. Your own creation is not an edit to someone else creation and is forbidden. Made from scratch in standard 3d software means your creation by you or partnership between two or more artists in collaboration are allowed only. 

if another concerned sansar user can bring solid evidence of this violation of sansar law. Evidence must be looked into by sansar moderation with full severity of violation. We as 3d artist that make models off of pure imagination and in spirit of generating original content should not have to deal with people that dont want to be original and do the same. 3d modeling can be learned and it just takes time. It is a requirement to upload to the store to take the time to learn. Violating this law harms sansar because its a loss to sansar because talented artist may not be part of sansar due to competing stolen mesh model which doesnt allow sansar to be at its biggest potential in the 3d art gaming industry. 

you can bring in whatever 3d mesh for your personal experience for use but cannot sell in the marketplace

1st volation is a verbal warning and enforcement is removal and offending user understanding why it was removed. (documented public enforcement)
2nd violation is suspension of marketplace for one month. no upload no cashout of monies (documented public enforcement)
3rd violation complete bann of store which mean a complete bann of your avatar and account (documented public enforcement)
